   Non-marked files
   ----------------

   The license boilerplate has not been added to template files - since
   this would cause extra bandwidth requirements for web page downloads
   and add the boilerplate to outgoing mail etc. However - these files
   are covered by the same license.

   Binaries (images etc) are also not marked but considered covered.

   Third party libraries are of course covered by their own license.
